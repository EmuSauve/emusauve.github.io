                    <strong>Project background:</strong> As a final project of the UX/UI Design Bootcamp, our team
                    decided to redesign Costco Wholesale’s website.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Project type:</strong> Group project / team of 3<br>
                    <strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 weeks<br>
                    <strong>My role:</strong> UX researcher, front-end developer<br>
                    <strong>Tool used:</strong> Miro, Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Slick<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>The problem:</strong> Due to the pandemic, more people stopped shopping at actual stores and
                    began shopping online. However, Costco's great selection of products and services, which is one of
                    Costco's attractions, makes the website unpleasantly dense and not a desirable place to shop for
                    those users who want to minimize their time browsing e-commerce websites.<br>
                    <strong>The solution:</strong> Redesign the existing website by organizing navigation systems and
                    implementing intuitive UI design with properly categorized sections and limiting the over-exposure
                    of products and services, so that users are able to focus on their goals.

                    Costco Wholesale is an American multinational corporation which operates a chain of membership-only
                    big-box retail stores. Because of the pandemic, many customers are switching from in-store shopping
                    to online. However, we believe that Costco is missing an opportunity to convert these customers due
                    to a user experience which overwhelms first-time visitors especially those who are used to
                    targeted-shopping rather than browsing. That’s why we have chosen to redesign the Costco wholesale
                    website.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Since the pandemic started, our interviewees reduced their frequency of in-store
                                shopping, and they have never used Costco.ca for online shopping. This means regular
                                customers simply stopped shopping with Costco.</li>
                            <li>Instead of shopping at Costco, people are going to less busy stores or buying groceries
                                using other shopping websites such as Amazon and Walmart. </li>
                            <li>Users are not happy to shop at the Costco website because of its cluttered content and
                                dense information makes customers want to leave the site.</li>
                            <li>People want to easily find deal information on the Costco website. The thrifty prices
                                are the most popular reason why people shop at Costco.</li>
                            <li>Users do not like spending much time shopping online. Their behavior is more
                                targeted-buying than browsing.</li>

                        Several interviewees mentioned that Costco.ca reminds of them actual Costco stores: so many
                        things going on. Besides their thrifty price, the wide range of products and services is one of
                        reason why Costco attracts customers. It provide positive shopping experience when people shop
                        at stores. However, when that consept is presented on the website, the experience became rather
                        overwhelming because the space is very limited and the way information can be conveyed is only
                        by text or images. There need to be a different approach tailered to web.

                        time and money spent online?”

                        The biggest constraint I had with the front-end development phase was time; our whole project timeline was two weeks, so the time I could spend building the prototype was quite limited.
                        Therefore, I did research and decided to use the CSS framework Bootstrap and jQuery plugin Slick to reduce the time of developing some complicated components. To align with the wireframe design, I restyled them with CSS overrides.

                        To reduce repetition of code, I used utility classes and component-specific classes in different situations.

                </div>

                <div class="marginBottomBig">
                    <p>
                        Utility classes:
                    </p>
                    <div class="responsiveFlexBox">
                        <div class="twoColumnFlexChild marginBottomSmall">
                            <img src="images/costco/utility-classes.png" alt="Utility classes image">
                        </div>
                        <div class="twoColumnFlexChild">
                            <p>
                                One example of using utility classes in this project was flexbox. Since flexbox was heavily used in all pages, I created classes with different flexbox styles. Depending on the design, I was able to use those classes in HTML and avoid writing those styles repeatedly in CSS. It also prevented making too-specific classes that can be only used for certain components.

                <div class="marginBottomBig">
                    <p>
                        Component-specific classes:
                    </p>
                    <div class="responsiveFlexBox">
                        <div class="twoColumnFlexChild marginBottomSmall">

                                I used component-specific classes for some components that appear often throughout the site, such as buttons or cards.
                                This kept the HTML clean, and it became easier to change those components’ styles in the future if necessary.

                        </div>

                        I worked as a UX researcher and FE developer in this project, and it was a great experience because I made many discoveries and learned a lot. For example, using a framework and library helped me shorten the time developing complicated components in the tight project schedule. However, many specific hard-coded CSS rules were required to override their default style, and the code got longer and more complicated. I learned the pros and cons of using frameworks and libraries and how the choice of whether to use them or not depends on project style. This experience gave me perspective as an FE developer in addition to the designer's point of view. I believe that this will help me make more easily implementable design decisions in the future.
